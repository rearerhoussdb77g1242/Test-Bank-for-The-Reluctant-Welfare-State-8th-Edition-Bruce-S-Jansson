  * Written in clear, lively prose, this highly respected book analyzes the evolution of the American welfare state from colonial times to present. The author examines how social welfare policy connects to an empowerment perspective, by showing how African Americans, Latinos, women, gays and lesbians, Asian Americans, Native Americans, the elderly, the poor, and other vulnerable populations, as well as social reformers, have achieved progressive reforms through policy advocacy. Part of the BROOKS/COLE EMPOWERMENT SERIES, THE RELUCTANT WELFARE STATE, 8th Edition, aims to help readers develop the core competencies and practice behaviors outlined in the 2008 Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) set by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE).
